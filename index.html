                    My name is Michelle and I'm currently pursuing to be a fullstack developer. I recently graduated from University of California, Riverside, with a degree in Psychology and during my undergrad career, I studied hard to pursue physical therapy. 
                    
                    The only thing I really focused on, career wise, was just to finish school, prepare for my GREs, and apply to graduate school. But, the thing is, I've always been interested in coding and technology in general. However, I've never really gave much thought
                    
                    to act upon my interests because I was just focused on what was expected of me from social expectations - to graduate and go to graduate school.  Upon my early graduation, I decided to take an expensive leap and jump out of my comfort zone and pursue my interests...hoping that it could lead to 

                    an interesting and worthwhile experience.
